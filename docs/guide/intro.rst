What is MACE ?
--------------

MACE provides fast and accurate machine learning interatomic potentials with higher order equivariant message passing.
For faster training and inference using the cuEquivariance library, please read the `CUDA acceleration with cuequivariance library <cuda_acceleration>`_ section.

Also available: 

- `MACE in JAX <https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-jax>`_, currently about 2x times faster at evaluation, but training is recommended in PyTorch for optimal performances and features.
- `MACE layers <https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-layer>`_, for constructing higher order equivariant graph neural networks for arbitrary 3D point clouds.
