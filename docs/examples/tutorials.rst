Tutorials on MACE training and architecture
============================================

We have built a series of tutorials to help you get started with MACE. 
These tutorials are designed to help you understand the basics of MACE, how to train a model, and how to use it in your own projects.
The tutorials were made by Ioan MagdÄƒu, Ilyes Batatia and Will Baldwin.
All tutorials are available on Google Colab, so you can run them in your browser without any setup.
If you want want to run the tutorials locally, you can download the notebooks from Google Colab.
