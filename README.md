## About MACE

MACE provides fast and accurate machine learning interatomic potentials with higher order equivariant message passing.

This repository contains the MACE reference implementation developed by
Ilyes Batatia, Gregor Simm, and David Kovacs.

Also available:

- [MACE in JAX](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-jax), currently about 2x times faster at evaluation, but training is recommended in Pytorch for optimal performances.
- [MACE layers](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-layer) for constructing higher order equivariant graph neural networks for arbitrary 3D point clouds.

## Documentation

A partial documentation is available at: https://mace-docs.readthedocs.io

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python >= 3.7
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) >= 1.12

(for openMM, use Python = 3.9)

### conda installation

If you do not have CUDA pre-installed, it is **recommended** to follow the conda installation process:

```sh
# Create a virtual environment and activate it
conda create --name mace_env
conda activate mace_env

# Install PyTorch
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# (optional) Install MACE's dependencies from Conda as well
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib ase opt_einsum prettytable pandas e3nn

# Clone and install MACE (and all required packages)
git clone https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace.git
pip install ./mace
```

### pip installation

To install via `pip`, follow the steps below:

```sh
# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv mace-venv
source mace-venv/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch (for example, for CUDA 11.6 [cu116])
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116

# Clone and install MACE (and all required packages)
git clone https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace.git
pip install ./mace
```

**Note:** The homonymous package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/MACE/) has nothing to do with this one.

## Usage

### Training

To train a MACE model, you can use the `mace_run_train` script, which should be in the usual place that pip places binaries (or you can explicitly run `python3 <path_to_cloned_dir>/mace/cli/run_train.py`)

```sh
mace_run_train \
    --name="MACE_model" \
    --train_file="train.xyz" \
    --valid_fraction=0.05 \
    --test_file="test.xyz" \
    --config_type_weights='{"Default":1.0}' \
    --E0s='{1:-13.663181292231226, 6:-1029.2809654211628, 7:-1484.1187695035828, 8:-2042.0330099956639}' \
    --model="MACE" \
    --hidden_irreps='128x0e + 128x1o' \
    --r_max=5.0 \
    --batch_size=10 \
    --max_num_epochs=1500 \
    --swa \
    --start_swa=1200 \
    --ema \
    --ema_decay=0.99 \
    --amsgrad \
    --restart_latest \
    --device=cuda \
```

To give a specific validation set, use the argument `--valid_file`. To set a larger batch size for evaluating the validation set, specify `--valid_batch_size`.

To control the model's size, you need to change `--hidden_irreps`. For most applications, the recommended default model size is `--hidden_irreps='256x0e'` (meaning 256 invariant messages) or `--hidden_irreps='128x0e + 128x1o'`. If the model is not accurate enough, you can include higher order features, e.g., `128x0e + 128x1o + 128x2e`, or increase the number of channels to `256`.

It is usually preferred to add the isolated atoms to the training set, rather than reading in their energies through the command line like in the example above. To label them in the training set, set `config_type=IsolatedAtom` in their info fields. If you prefer not to use or do not know the energies of the isolated atoms, you can use the option `--E0s="average"` which estimates the atomic energies using least squares regression.

If the keyword `--swa` is enabled, the energy weight of the loss is increased for the last ~20% of the training epochs (from `--start_swa` epochs). This setting usually helps lower the energy errors.

The precision can be changed using the keyword `--default_dtype`, the default is `float64` but `float32` gives a significant speed-up (usually a factor of x2 in training).

The keywords `--batch_size` and `--max_num_epochs` should be adapted based on the size of the training set. The batch size should be increased when the number of training data increases, and the number of epochs should be decreased. An heuristic for initial settings, is to consider the number of gradient update constant to 200 000, which can be computed as $\text{max-num-epochs}*\frac{\text{num-configs-training}}{\text{batch-size}}$.

The code can handle training set with heterogeneous labels, for example containing both bulk structures with stress and isolated molecules. In this example, to make the code ignore stress on molecules, append to your molecules configuration a `config_stress_weight = 0.0`.

To use Apple Silicon GPU acceleration make sure to install the latest PyTorch version and specify `--device=mps`.

### Evaluation

To evaluate your MACE model on an XYZ file, run the `mace_eval_configs`:

```sh
mace_eval_configs \
    --configs="your_configs.xyz" \
    --model="your_model.model" \
    --output="./your_output.xyz"
```

## Tutorial

You can run our [Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D6EtMUjQPey_GkuxUAbPgld6_9ibIa-V?authuser=1#scrollTo=Z10787RE1N8T) to quickly get started with MACE. 

We also have a more detailed user and developer tutorial at https://github.com/ilyes319/mace-tutorials

## Weights and Biases for experiment tracking

If you would like to use MACE with Weights and Biases to log your experiments simply install with

```sh
pip install ./mace[wandb]
```

And specify the necessary keyword arguments (`--wandb`, `--wandb_project`, `--wandb_entity`, `--wandb_name`, `--wandb_log_hypers`)


## Pretrained Foundation Models

### Materials Project

We have collaborated with the Materials Project (MP) who trained universal MACE checkpoints covering 89 elements on 1.6 M bulk crystals in the [MPTrj dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/23713842) selected from MP relaxation trajectories. These pretrained models were used for materials stability prediction in [Matbench Discovery](https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org) and the corresponding [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14920). For easy reuse, these checkpoints were published on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cyrusyc/mace-universal) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/22715158) with direct download links for the [`medium`](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/42374049) and [`large`](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/43117273) checkpoints.

### MACE-OFF: Transferable Organic Force Fields

There is a series (small, medium, large) transferable organic force fields. These can be used for the simulation of organic molecules, crystals and molecular liquids, or as a starting point for fine-tuning on a new dataset. The models are released under the [ASL license](https://github.com/gabor1/ASL). If you use them please cite [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15211) which also contains detailed benchmarks and example applications.

#### Example usage in ASE
```py
from mace.calculators import mace_off
from ase import build

atoms = build.molecule('H2O')
calc = mace_off(model="medium", device='cuda')
atoms.set_calculator(calc)
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())
```

## Development

We use `black`, `isort`, `pylint`, and `mypy`.
Run the following to format and check your code:

```sh
bash ./scripts/run_checks.sh
```

We have CI set up to check this, but we _highly_ recommend that you run those commands
before you commit (and push) to avoid accidentally committing bad code.
